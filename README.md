Online Payment Analysis Project

This project is based on simple analysis of online payment methods using Python.
It is created for practice and learning purpose.

In this project, a small dataset is used which contains different payment methods
and their transaction amounts.

Dataset:
The dataset file name is payment_data.csv.
It has two columns:
payment_type – shows the type of payment method
transaction_amount – shows the amount of each transaction

Steps followed in the code:

Step 1:
First, pandas and matplotlib libraries are imported.

Step 2:
The CSV file is loaded using pandas and stored in a dataframe.

Step 3:
The complete dataset is printed in the output so that all rows can be seen.

Step 4:
Statistical analysis is performed on the transaction_amount column.
Total transactions, total amount, average, maximum and minimum values are calculated.

Step 5:
A bar chart is created to show the total transaction amount for each payment method.

Step 6:
A pie chart is created to show the usage distribution of payment methods.

Output:
The output shows the full dataset, statistical values, a bar chart and a pie chart.
These graphs help to understand the data easily.

Conclusion:
This project helped me understand how basic data analysis and visualization
can be done using Python. It is a simple beginner level project.
